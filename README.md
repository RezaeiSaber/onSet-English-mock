## ✨ Why I Built This

Hi! I'm a student who was preparing for the **onSET English language test** — an exam often required for scholarships, exchange programs, and academic placements in Germany.

As I started studying, I quickly realized something:
> **There were barely any good practice resources available online.**

No realistic Cloze-style tests.  
No timer-based simulations.  
No interactive scoring — nothing close to what the actual onSET feels like.

So I thought to myself:
> “If I’m struggling to find good tools, others probably are too.”

That’s how this project was born — out of personal need, but also out of a desire to **support the community**.  
I built this app not just for myself, but for every learner out there trying to prepare properly for the onSET English test — especially students with limited access to resources.
